Learning new languages, skills, and technologies is a really important part of being a developer. Being a programmer means you will need to be a lifelong learner, and constantly be learning new things. 

Your goal will be to explore, research, and experiment.

You will have a month to complete the following assignments. Realsitically, you will not be able to learn a full language in a month, but that's OK...the goal isn't too learn everything, the goal is to learn how to learn new things.

- Choose your path:
  1. Elm
  2. Ruby on Rails 
  3. Python 
  
 - Prepare your tech talk 
 
 - Write a research paper
 
 - Choose a project (as your goal)
