# Language Self Study

Learning new languages, skills, and technologies is a really important part of being a developer. Being a programmer means you will need to be a lifelong learner, and constantly be learning new things. 

Your goal will be to explore, research, and experiment.

You will have a month to complete the following assignments. Realsitically, you will not be able to learn a full language in a month, but that's OK...the goal isn't too learn everything, the goal is to learn how to learn new things.

## Choose your path:
  1. Elm
  2. Ruby on Rails 
  3. Python 
  
## Choose a project (as your goal) 
Choose a project that you'd like to work on to reinforce your new skills. Choose something you're excited about. It's always easier to motivate yourself to learn when you have an exciting end goal in mind. 

Choose something big or small. You don't necessarily have to finish the project you choose...it can be an ongoing thing. Just be sure to choose something that you'll actually be invested in.
 
## Write a research paper
As part of your independent study you'll need to write a research paper on your language. Papers should be 2 - 3 pages single spaced, and should cover:

- Brief history/overview of the language 
- Brief overview of some of the pros and cons of the language 
- Practical examples of how the language is being used in the wider the industry 
- Compare and contrast the language to JavaScript 
- Future prospects/plans of the language (if applicable) 
- List of resources and/or citations

The goal of the research paper is to both help you get a systematic and thorough understanding of your topic, and to make it easier for you to each it to other people. It will also be practice for researching and writing, both of which will be very important moving forward in your career.
