Learning new languages, skills, and technologies is a really important part of being a developer. Being a programmer means you will need to be a lifelong learner, and constantly be learning new things. 

Your goal will be to explore, research, and experiment.

You will have a month to complete the following assignments. Realsitically, you will not be able to learn a full language in a month, but that's OK...the goal isn't too learn everything, the goal is to learn how to learn new things.

## Choose your path:
  1. Elm
  2. Ruby on Rails 
  3. Python 
  
## Choose a project (as your goal) 
Choose a project that you'd like to work on to reinforce your new skills. Choose something you're excited about. It's always easier to motivate yourself to learn when you have an exciting end goal in mind. 

Choose something big or small. You don't necessarily have to finish the project you choose...it can be an ongoing thing. Just be sure to choose something that you'll actually be invested in.

## Prepare your tech talk 
As part of your research you'll be preparing a 'tech talk' on a topic of your choice, related to your language. In other words, you'll choose a specific topic that has something to do with your language, and give a 10 minute talk. We'll break into groups to give the talks, so you'll be giving your talk to roughly 8 - 12 people.

Topics can either be broad, or narrow. For example, you could do somthing like 'How to Build a Todo App with Elm', or you could do something really specific, like 'Object Oriented Iheritance in Python.' You can also mix and match with other technologies like 'Elm Architecture compared to Redux' or 'Building a Server in Ruby vs Node.' Get creative! Topics must be approved by an instructor, and you will have about a week to decide on your topic.

You should prepare a slide deck (or other teaching materials) for your talk. You can either present it as a traditional lecture/talk, or you could do a more interactive workshop style talk (or a combo of the two).

The goal of these talks will be both the practice learning and teaching a new skill, and to practice your public speaking and presentation skills. 

A successful tech talk will meet the following criteria:
- Well prepared and practiced 
- Professional presentation 

 
## Write a research paper
As part of your independent study you'll need to write a research paper on your language. Papers should be 2 - 3 pages single spaced, and should cover:

- Brief history/overview of the topic 
- Practical examples of how the topic is being used in code and in the wider the industry 
- Compare and contrast the topic to other similar options/solutions out there
- Compare and contrast the topic to similar solutions in JavaScript 
- Future prospects/plans of the topic (if applicable) 
- List of resources  and/or citations

The goal of the research paper is to both help you get a systematic and thorough understanding of your topic, and to make it easier for you to each it to other people. It will also be practice for researching and writing, both of which will be very important moving forward in your career. 

## Due Dates
- 3/13/17: Select your topic for you talk and get it approved by Nate
- 3/20/17: Outline of your research paper AND outline of your talk
- 3/27/17: First draft of your research paper AND first draft of your talk slides/material
- 4/3/17: Final draft of your paper AND final draft of your talk
