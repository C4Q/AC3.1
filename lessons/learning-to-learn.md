# Tips For Learning New Technologies and Skills

- Have a goal in mind (for example, a specific project) 
- Start with a 'fly-by' overview 
- Make a list of the BEST resources, and focus on those
- Balance your time between reading/watching/learning and actively coding/doing 
- Write notes like you're going to teach it to someone else
- Then actually teach it to someone else
- Keep a [beginners mind](http://www.inc.com/rhett-power/11-ways-how-to-develop-a-beginner-s-mind.html) - "In the beginners mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind there are few"
