# Tips For Learning New Technologies and Skills

- Have a goal in mind (for example, a specific project) 
- Start with a 'fly-by' overview (a very high level overview where you get a feel for the overall picture)
- Make a list of the BEST resources, and focus on those
- Make a list of questions that you'd like to eventually be able to answer 
- Balance your time between reading/watching/learning and actively coding/doing 
- Write notes like you're going to teach it to someone else
- Then actually teach it to someone else
- Always aim for understanding instead of memorization 
- Start over, and make multiple passes over the material (most things don't really start to sink in until you've tried learning them from the beginning at least 3 or 4 times) 
- Keep a [beginners mind](http://www.inc.com/rhett-power/11-ways-how-to-develop-a-beginner-s-mind.html) - "In the beginners mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind there are few"
